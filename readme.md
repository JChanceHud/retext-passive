# retext-passive [![Build][build-badge]][build] [![Coverage][coverage-badge]][coverage] [![Downloads][downloads-badge]][downloads] [![Chat][chat-badge]][chat]

Check for passive voice with [**retext**][retext].

## Installation

[npm][]:

```bash
npm install retext-passive
```

## Usage

Say we have the following file, `example.txt`:

```text
He was withheld while we were being fed.
```

And our script, `example.js`, looks like this:

```javascript
var vfile = require('to-vfile')
var report = require('vfile-reporter')
var unified = require('unified')
var english = require('retext-english')
var stringify = require('retext-stringify')
var passive = require('retext-passive')

unified()
  .use(english)
  .use(passive)
  .use(stringify)
  .process(vfile.readSync('example.txt'), function(err, file) {
    console.error(report(err || file))
  })
```

Now, running `node example` yields:

```text
example.txt
   1:8-1:16  warning  Don’t use the passive voice  withheld  retext-passive
  1:37-1:40  warning  Don’t use the passive voice  fed       retext-passive

⚠ 2 warnings
```
